1. I really liked the concept for your hackathon project it’s ambitious, creative, and useful. However, it is a bit too specific, and because of that, you have struggled to integrate some APIs that could have helped you. The scope of the project would require more time to fully realize its potential, so in a short timeframe, it might have been difficult to execute everything.

2. It’s great that you commented on every step in your code. This makes it much easier for others, like me, to understand your code from scratch, which is always a good practice.

3. Your code structure is solid, but it could be even better if you followed this structure:   
📁main folder __
                |
                📁config __
                            📝db.js
                📁controllers __
                                📝restaurentController.js
                📁models__
                            📝restaurentModels.js
                📁routes__
                            📝restaurentRoutes.js
                📁server.js

4. In your routes folder, the content inside app.js should actually be inside db.js. This will keep your code organization cleaner.

6. Don't forget next time to use gitignore to ignore files you don't want to push to github, as node_modules (because it's a really heavy file) and .env file (because you have your password and all you information for neon there).

5. In conclusion, your code is readable and well-organized, but it could be cleaner. If this project is important to you, I suggest revisiting it as a final project so you can dedicate more time to it and make the improvements it deserves.
